Install ncc
npm install -g @zeit/ncc

Using ncc
When you use ncc:

ncc build <input-file>

A new directory named dist will be created. Within that directory you will find a file named index.js. 
To tell GitHub Actions that this new index.js file is the one that should run when your action is used 
a small edit to the action.yml file needs to be made.

before:

runs:
  using: "node12"
  main: "index.js"

after:

runs:
  using: "node12"
  main: "dist/index.js"
  
Once you make this change you can delete the node_modules folder and commit those changes to the 
repository that contains your Actions source code.
